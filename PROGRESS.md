# Job Agent — Daily Progress Log

## 2026-05-01 (Day 4) — Re-entry + Phase 3 prep

### Context
- 11-day gap since Day 3 (motivation + post-work exhaustion). Deliberate gentle re-entry: small wins, ship every commit, no Playwright tonight.

### Shipped
- **Sentry error tracking + tracing** — `@sentry/nextjs` across client/server/edge runtimes. DSN env-driven (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`), `tracesSampleRate` scales by env (1.0 dev / 0.1 prod), `sendDefaultPii: false` (resume app — no PII to third party). Verified end-to-end with the wizard's example page, then deleted.
- **GitHub Actions CI** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: type-check (`tsc --noEmit`) + lint on every push and PR to master. Node 22, npm cache, Prisma generate step. ~1.5 min per run.
- **Seed script** — `prisma/seed.ts` creates 15 fake companies + 100 applications via Faker. Production-guarded, idempotent (deletes seeded rows first), parallel inserts via `Promise.all`. Realistic status funnel via cumulative-distribution weighted random picker (DSA: same algorithm as weighted load balancers). `@faker-js/faker` + `tsx` added as devDeps.
- **README upgrade** — replaced Next.js boilerplate with portfolio-grade README: status badges (CI live), pitch, "why this exists" story, features (shipped vs coming), tech stack, getting-started, project structure, roadmap with phase checkboxes, engineering principles, MIT license.
- **LICENSE file** — MIT, ©2026 Mohit.
- **SECURITY.md** + GitHub Dependabot/secret-scanning toggles enabled. Confirmed live (Dependabot already flagged 2 moderate vulns on first push).
- **Health check `/api/health`** — pings Prisma (`SELECT 1`) + Redis (`PING`) in parallel via `Promise.all`. Returns 200 with `{status:"ok"}` when both up, 503 with `{status:"degraded"}` otherwise. Public endpoint, no auth.
- **Singleton Redis client** at `src/lib/redis.ts` — `ioredis` with `lazyConnect: true`, globalThis pattern for HMR safety. BullMQ-ready for Phase 6.

### Decisions made
- Phase 3 (Playwright + scrapers) deliberately deferred to tomorrow — tonight was re-entry, not progress
- Cadence reset acknowledged: weekday 2-hr target was aspirational; build for 30–60 min reality
- Did NOT run `npm audit fix` despite 5 moderate vulns from new devDeps — likely transitive in pdf-parse area, defer to Phase 8 dep audit
- Did NOT upgrade Prisma 6 → 7 despite update prompt — major version, breaking changes, Phase 8 territory

### Carried over (deferred, not blocking)
- [x] Health check `/api/health` — done same session
- [x] `SECURITY.md` + GitHub secret scanning — done same session
- [ ] Multi-resume profile UI (Phase 5/7)
- [ ] Production deploy (Phase 8)
- [ ] Rotate Groq + Google OAuth + Cloudinary keys eventually (paranoia hygiene; secrets briefly visible during config session)

### Hygiene notes for future-me
- Stay on `npx prisma db push` until Phase 8 baseline migration. **Never run `migrate dev`** — wiped DB on Day 3.
- Prisma's `package.json#prisma` config is deprecated — Prisma 7 wants `prisma.config.ts`. Migrate when upgrading.
- Soft-delete `$extends` only on Resume model. Extend to Application when soft-delete on apps lands in Phase 4.

### Next session (Day 5) — one objective
**Sketch Phase 3 architecture on paper, no code.** Define the `Scraper` interface, per-source adapters (LinkedIn / Naukri / Instahyre / generic), where Redis caching fits, where BullMQ fits. 30–60 min thinking before any keystroke.

## 2026-04-20 (Day 3) — Phase 2 fully closed

### Shipped
- **Cloudinary file storage:** SDK + helper with Zod-validated upload response, raw uploads to `resumes/<userId>/`, download button on detail page (`fl_attachment` forces download)
- **Schema:** `cloudinaryPublicId` added to Resume (for future cleanup jobs)
- **Avatar fix:** whitelisted Google + GitHub hosts in next.config, switched Header to `next/image` to avoid Google 429 rate limits
- **Phase 2 gap audit + fixes:**
  - `projects[]` extraction added to ResumeSchema, prompt, and edit form (was missing per PDF)
  - LLM retry: refactored `extractResumeData` to retry once with corrective prompt (`buildCorrectivePrompt` uses `error.issues`), throws on second failure — no more silent `safeParse` bypass
- **Soft-delete on Resume (Phase 4 work pulled forward):** `deletedAt DateTime?` + index, Prisma `$extends` query middleware auto-filters `deletedAt: null` on all reads (modern API; `$use` deprecated in Prisma 6)

### Decisions made
- Multi-resume profile UI **deferred** — Phase 5 will use a per-application resume picker (cleaner than `isDefault`), Phase 7 enforces Free-tier limit
- Sentry **deferred to next session** (option (a) wizard or (b) manual TBD)
- Deployment gate **relaxed**: PDF puts formal deploy at Phase 8; "deploy from Phase 1" is best-practice nudge in §19 Common Mistakes, not a hard checkpoint. Continuing to Phase 3 without prod deploy
- Database wiped today (mixed `db push` + `migrate dev` reset everything) — staying on `db push` until Phase 8 baseline migration

### Bugs fixed mid-session
- DB wiped → recreated via `npx prisma db push` + re-login
- Google avatar 429 → `next/image` proxies and caches server-side

### Phase 2 gaps still open (deferred, not blocking)
- [ ] Sentry error tracking (next session)
- [ ] Production deploy (Phase 8)
- [ ] Multi-resume profile UI (Phase 5/7)

## 2026-04-19 (Day 2) — Phase 2 mostly done

### Shipped
- `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` — Zod-validated env vars at startup
- Resume upload UI: react-dropzone + sonner toasts
- File parsing: `pdf-parse` v2 (PDF) + `mammoth` (DOCX)
- Groq structured extraction with Zod (`ResumeSchema`)
- Resume list page (`/dashboard/resumes`)
- Resume detail/edit page (`/dashboard/resumes/[id]`) with React Hook Form + `useFieldArray` for dynamic sections
- `PATCH /api/resumes/[id]` with ownership check pattern
- JWT session callback — `session.user.id` now available in API routes
- `WebhookEvent` model added to Prisma schema (for Phase 7 idempotency)
- Improved extraction prompt with explicit JSON template + pattern hints

### Tested with
- 3 different resumes — extraction is reasonably good now
- Edit UI saves changes correctly
- Upload auto-redirects to detail page

### Phase 2 gaps still open (finish tomorrow morning)
- [ ] **Cloudinary upload + download** — store original PDF, add download button on detail page. Env vars already wired, just need signup + 3 keys + one API integration.
- [ ] **Deploy to production** — blueprint says Phase 1 should already be live. We're 2 phases in with no live URL. Deploy target: Oracle Cloud ARM VM.
- [ ] **LLM retry with adjusted prompt on invalid JSON** — currently `safeParse` fallback only. Deferred.

### Decisions made
- Deferred Cloudinary originally, user pushed back and rightfully prioritised completion over forward motion
- Chose not to build multiple-resume-profile UI (schema supports it, low priority)
- Added two new teaching principles to CLAUDE.md: pace guardrail + deployment gate
